    "In this lecture, we learned some ways to look at the data. We learned how to load the data into a numpy array called `data`. We also learned how to extract different rows and columns from the data. For example, to just get the column corresponding to the strength of the ceramic materials (column 4), we used the command `Y = data[:, 4]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also learned how to use numpy to calculate summary statistics for an array of numerical data. Specifically, we saw how to calculate\n",
    "* Mean values using `np.mean`\n",
    "* Median values using `np.median`\n",
    "* Standard deviation using `np.std`\n",
    "* Maximum and minimum values using `np.max` and `np.min`\n",
    "\n",
    "We also learned how to visualize the data with some plots using the `matplotlib.pyplot` and `scipy.stats` packages. Specifically, we saw how to make the following plots:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Run plots (`plt.plot(Y)`)- which plots data values vs. row index.\n",
    "* Histograms (`plt.hist(Y)`) - which shows the frequency of values among the data.\n",
    "* Boxplots (`plt.boxplot(Y)` or `plt.boxplot(Y_list)`) - which shows one or several box plots, which are one dimensional representations of the data showing median values, the interval between 25% and 75% percentiles, outliers, and range of the data.\n",
    "* QQ plots (`scipy.stats.probplot`) - which allows us to compare observed data to specific distributions, such as the Normal distribution.\n",
    "* Scatter plots (`plt.scatter`) - which plots two variables against each other as $(x,y)$ pairs of points.\n",
    "\n",
    "We lastly showed how to condition your data, that is pick subsets of your data ccording to some condition. For example, we wanted to get the $Y$ values that correspond to when the batch was equal to 1, which we wrote as $Y | B = 1$ and used the phrase \"Y given B equal to 1\". To do this in python, we used Boolean indexing which was done in two steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Define an array of True/False values in which the \"True\" values correspond to the data we want to extract. For example, we made such an *index array* `I_B1 = (B == 1)` to be True when the batch equaled 1, and False otherwise.\n",
    "* Use the index array to extract the proper subset from the response array $Y$ using `Y_given_B1 = Y[I_B1]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "We used this to perform a similar analysis on subsets of the $Y$ data corresponding to specific batches or specific labs. We then compared the results of this analysis between batches and labs to see if these had a significant effect on the statistics of $Y$.\n"
